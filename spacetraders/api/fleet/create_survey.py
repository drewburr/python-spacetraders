     Create surveys on a waypoint that can be extracted such as asteroid fields. A survey focuses on
    specific types of deposits from the extracted location. When ships extract using this survey, they
    are guaranteed to procure a high amount of one of the goods in the survey.

    In order to use a survey, send the entire survey details in the body of the extract request.

    Each survey may have multiple deposits, and if a symbol shows up more than once, that indicates a
    higher chance of extracting that resource.

    Your ship will enter a cooldown after surveying in which it is unable to perform certain actions.
    Surveys will eventually expire after a period of time or will be exhausted after being extracted
    several times based on the survey's size. Multiple ships can use the same survey for extraction.
