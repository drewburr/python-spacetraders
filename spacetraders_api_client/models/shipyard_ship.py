        frame (ShipFrame): The frame of the ship. The frame determines the number of modules and mounting points of the
            ship, as well as base fuel capacity. As the condition of the frame takes more wear, the ship will become more
            sluggish and less maneuverable.
        reactor (ShipReactor): The reactor of the ship. The reactor is responsible for powering the ship's systems and
            weapons.
        engine (ShipEngine): The engine determines how quickly a ship travels between waypoints.

        activity (Union[Unset, ActivityLevel]): The activity level of a trade good. If the good is an import, this
            represents how strong consumption is. If the good is an export, this represents how strong the production is for
            the good. When activity is strong, consumption or production is near maximum capacity. When activity is weak,
            consumption or production is near minimum capacity.
