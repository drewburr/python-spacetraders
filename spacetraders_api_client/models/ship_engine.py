    """The engine determines how quickly a ship travels between waypoints.

    Attributes:
        symbol (ShipEngineSymbol): The symbol of the engine.
        name (str): The name of the engine.
        description (str): The description of the engine.
        condition (float): The repairable condition of a component. A value of 0 indicates the component needs
            significant repairs, while a value of 1 indicates the component is in near perfect condition. As the condition
            of a component is repaired, the overall integrity of the component decreases.
        integrity (float): The overall integrity of the component, which determines the performance of the component. A
            value of 0 indicates that the component is almost completely degraded, while a value of 1 indicates that the
            component is in near perfect condition. The integrity of the component is non-repairable, and represents
            permanent wear over time.
        speed (int): The speed stat of this engine. The higher the speed, the faster a ship can travel from one point to
            another. Reduces the time of arrival when navigating the ship.
        requirements (ShipRequirements): The requirements for installation on a ship
