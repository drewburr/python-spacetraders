    """The reactor of the ship. The reactor is responsible for powering the ship's systems and weapons.

    Attributes:
        symbol (ShipReactorSymbol): Symbol of the reactor.
        name (str): Name of the reactor.
        description (str): Description of the reactor.
        condition (float): The repairable condition of a component. A value of 0 indicates the component needs
            significant repairs, while a value of 1 indicates the component is in near perfect condition. As the condition
            of a component is repaired, the overall integrity of the component decreases.
        integrity (float): The overall integrity of the component, which determines the performance of the component. A
            value of 0 indicates that the component is almost completely degraded, while a value of 1 indicates that the
            component is in near perfect condition. The integrity of the component is non-repairable, and represents
            permanent wear over time.
        power_output (int): The amount of power provided by this reactor. The more power a reactor provides to the ship,
            the lower the cooldown it gets when using a module or mount that taxes the ship's power.
        requirements (ShipRequirements): The requirements for installation on a ship
